Territory: Represents a territory in diplomacy, with all name, abreviation, type, and 
           connection-sets. There are by default 4 connection-sets, one for each cardinal direction.
           If there is only one coastal set needed, by default north(0) is used.

       done to get around a problem with the fleets being able to jump peninsulas such as norway/sweeden
